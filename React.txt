REACT.Js
_______


In React we have two types of components
    i. Statefull or Smart  (  Have State  ) :
        - It's better to use less Stateful / Smart components, because if you use state component it will render many times.

    ii. Stateless or Dumb  (  Have no State  ) :
        - It's goood to use more Stateless / Dumb components.
