LINUX:
______

1. The linux system consist of five (5) key layers.
        a. User
        b. Application
        c. Operating system
        d. Kernel
        e. Hardware
2. Linux Distros:
            . Differ by UIs, their shell applications, and how the OS is supported and built.
            . The design of a distro is created towards its specific audience.
        i. Debian: Is stable, reliable, and open source.
        ii. Red Hat Enterprise Linux: Is focused on enterprise customers  
        iii. SUSE Linux Enterprise supports many architectures. Example: Raspberry Pi
3. Paths in the Linux File System:
        ~ --> Home directory
        / --> Root directory
        .. --> Parent of current directory
        . --> Current directory
4. Deb and Rpm Packages:
    i. .deb files:
        . Deb stands for Debian
        . For Debian based distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Mint.
    ii. .rmp files:
        . Rmp stands for Red Hat Package Manager
        . For Red Hat-based distributions such as CentOS/RHEL, Fedora, and openSUSE
    iii. Deb and Rpm formats are equivalent. If a package is only available in one format you can use alient to convert it.
        - RPM to deb: alien <package-name>.rpm
        - deb to RPM: alien -r <package-name>.deb
5. Update & Upgrade:
        - sudo apt update: to list all packages available on your distros. Download packages.
        - sudo apt upgrade: to download all package which you update. Install packages
6. Archiving and Compression:
        ARCHIVES:
                - Store rarely used information and preserve it
                - Are a collection of data files and directories stored as a single file
                - Make the collection more portable and serve as a backup in case of loss or corruption
        FILE COMPRESSION:
                - Reduces file size by reducing information redundancy
                - Preserves storage space, speeds up data transfer, and reduces bandwidth load
        ZIP:
                - Zip compress files and folder prior to archiving them
        TAR:
                - Tar archives files and folder into a tarball, and can also compress it


COMMANDS:
    
    1 - sudo apt update - (to list all packages available on your distros. Download packages)
    2 - sudo apt upgrade - (to download all package which you update. Install packages)
    3 - ls / or ls /bin - (if you know the path you can see the list of any directory from any where)
    4 - printenv SHELL - (default shell)
